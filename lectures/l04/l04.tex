\section{Recap - Variables}

\begin{frame}

Step 1: Write a module named \texttt{slist} saved in \texttt{slist.f90} that contains
\small
\begin{itemize}
    \item Type \texttt{Cell} consisting of an allocatable string ``\texttt{data}'' and a pointer to a \texttt{Cell} ``\texttt{next}''
    \item Type \texttt{SortedList} that contains an integer \texttt{length} and a pointer to a cell named \texttt{head}
    \item Subroutine \texttt{extend} that takes a \texttt{SortedList} and a string, creates a new \texttt{Cell}, adds it to the list so that the cells are sorted based on the string's first letter, and increments \texttt{length}.
    \item Subroutine \texttt{empty\_list} that takes a list and empties it taking care to deallocate memory correctly
    \item Function \texttt{pop} that returns the last cell of the list and removes it
    \item Recursive function \texttt{print\_forward} that prints all the strings in the list from last to first
    \item Recursive function \texttt{print\_reverse} that prints all strings in the list from first to last
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

Step 2: Write a program in a separate file that uses the \texttt{SortedList} module, creates a sorted list, adds the strings:

\vspace{2mm}
river, spark, melody, whisper, canyon, drift, lantern, echo, quartz, and breeze

\vspace{2mm}
to it, and prints the list in ascending and descending order.

% Write a makefile that compiles the module and the program, and has additionally a target named “test” that compiles everything and runs the program
