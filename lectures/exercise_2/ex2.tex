\begin{frame}
  \textbf{Exercise:} Multithreaded numerical integration of a system consisting of gravitationally interacting particles using the leapfrog integration method and Barnes-Hut algorigthm.
  \begin{itemize}
   \item See TAP p. 37-47 and p. 74-85
  \end{itemize}


  \textbf{To do}
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item Create makefile for the project.
   \item Separate the main program into its own program source code file.
   \item Separate the Barnes-Hut algorigthm into its own module.
   \item Modify the code to use the types and routines in the geometry and particle modules.
   \item Modify the program to write the simulation data into a file “output.dat”, where each line contains the simulation state as ``time p1x p1y p1z p2x p2y p2z ... pnx pny pnz''.
   \item Parallelise the code using OpenMP making sure that the code can be compiled with and without OpenMP support.
   \item Store your code in your personal ex2 directory, make pull requests as often as you feel like.
  \end{enumerate}
