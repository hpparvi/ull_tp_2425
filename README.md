# Programming Techniques course 24-25
- Course duration:  25 September – 27 November
- Place: CCA (Centro de Cálculo del Alumnado) and Aula 17
- Times: Mondays and Wednesdays, 15:00-17:00
- Teacher: Hannu Parviainen (hannu@iac.es)
- Teaching language: English


This course teaches the basics of modern Fortran programming in astrophysics, version control with Git, debugging, and code parallelisation with OpenMP and MPI.

Note: The first classes will be in Aula 17 from 15:00 to 17:00.

## Scoring
Two options:
- no final exam, but three equally weighted course exercises or
- a final exam that involves writing a fully working parallelised Fortran program with paper and a pen.


## Literature
- W.S. Brainerd "Guide to Fortran 2008 Programming" (London: Springer, 2015).
- P.S. Pacheco "Parallel Programming with MPI" (San Francisco, CA: Morgan Kaufmann, 1997).
- W. Gropp, E. Lusk, A. Skjellum "Using MPI: Portable Parallel Programming with the Message-Passing Interface" (3rd ed., Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2014).


## Additional literature
- S. Chacon and B. Straub "Pro Git".
- M. Metcalf, J. Reid, M. Cohen "Modern Fortran Explained" (2nd ed., NY: Oxford University Press, 2018). If the last edition of this book is not available, it can be substituted by previous editions from the same authors: "Modern Fortran Explained" (1st ed., 2011), "Fortran 95/2003 Explained" (2004), or "Fortran 90/95 Explained" (1996, 1999).

## Prerequisites

### For Windows users
You can find the instructions for installing GFortran in Windows from the fortran-lang.org website.

### For Mac users
The easiest way to install GNU Fortran in Mac is by creating a separate Anaconda environment:

    conda create -n fortran -c conda-forge compilers

After which the conda environment can be activated as

    conda activate fortran
