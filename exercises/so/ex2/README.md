# Multithread Dynamical Simulation using Barnes-Hut and OpenMP, by Oscar Soler Pérez
Here is included the fortran code written to perform a multithread numerical integration of a system consisting of gravitationally interacting particles using the leapfrog integration method and Barnes-Hut algorithm.
The code has been inspired by the notes of the course Técnicas Avanzadas de Programación 2018-2019, Ángel de Vicente, pages 37-47 and pages 74-85.


Initial conditions are created as N point particles randomly distributed in a sphere.
