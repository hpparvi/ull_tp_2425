# Compile the main program with the modules
gfortran -o ex1 ex1.f90 particle.o geometry.o

# Run the compiled program

# Running the program and outputs

When executing the program, you will be prompted to enter values directly in the terminal. Each value should be entered one at a time, pressing Enter after each input. For example, if you select the option to simulate with two particles, you will need to enter each particleâ€™s mass, coordinates, and initial velocities in the following order:
For Particle 1:
  - Mass
  - X coordinate
  - Y coordinate
  - Z coordinate
  - Velocity in X direction
  - Velocity in Y direction
  - Velocity in Z direction
For Particle 2:
  - Mass
  - X coordinate
  - Y coordinate
  - Z coordinate
  - Velocity in X direction
  - Velocity in Y direction
  - Velocity in Z direction

Each prompt will ask for a single value in the sequence shown above. Once you input the value, press Enter, and then proceed to the next.

The program outputs a file called orbits.txt with the following structure:
  Column 1: Time instant
  Column 2: Particle ID (e.g., 1 or 2 in the case of 2-body problem)
  Column 3: X coordinate
  Column 4: Y coordinate
  Column 5: Z coordinate
