# Course exercises

## First steps

1. Create a directory named using the initials of your surname(s) and first name(s) under the `exercises` directory (in lower-case letters). For example, I (Hannu Parviainen) would create a directory `ph`.
2. Create subdirectories `ex1`, `ex2`, and `ex3` under this directory.
3. Create empty README.md files under each exercise directory.
  
Now, your directory tree should look like:
  
    exercises
    |- ph
    ||- ex1
    |||- README.md
    ||- ex2
    |||- README.md
    ||- ex3
    |||- README.md

4. Edit this README.md file to include your name and the name of the directory you created under the "Students" section below.
5. Stage all the README.md files using `git add` and commit the changes using `git commit`.
6. Push the changes to GitHub using `git push`.
7. In GitHub, open a pull request telling me you have reached this far.
