# N-body problem with leapfrog
In this exercise we have done a simulation of n-body using the leapfrog algoristm.
I have done geometry and particle modules and ex1 program. Also, I have done a Makefile.

Using this program I have done 3 different simulations:
- In the first one called 'orbita inestable' I have done a simulation with 2 bodies in an unestable orbit and we can see how the body who is orbiting is getting more and more closer to the center.
- In the second one called 'orbita estable' I have done the same simulation as before but now I have try to use determinates values in order to obtain an estable orbit.
- Finally, the simulation called '3 cuerpos' is the exercise in the TAP. I used the values in the book and I obtained the same plot as in the book.

For every simulation I have uploaded a .txt with the data and a .png with the plot. Also, there is a .txt called 'Condiciones iniciales' with the initial conditions for every simulation.
